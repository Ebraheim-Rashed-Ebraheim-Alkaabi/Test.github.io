        <h2>Managing Stress: Techniques for a Calmer Life</h2>
        <p>Stress is a part of life, but managing it effectively can make a huge difference in your well-being. Here are some techniques to help you manage stress:</p>

        <h3>1. Practice Mindfulness</h3>
        <p>Mindfulness is about staying present in the moment and being aware of your thoughts without judgment. It helps reduce stress by grounding you in the present.</p>

        <h3>2. Exercise Regularly</h3>
        <p>Physical activity releases endorphins, which naturally reduce stress. Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise a few times a week.</p>

        <h3>3. Manage Your Time</h3>
        <p>Effective time management can prevent feeling overwhelmed. Break tasks into smaller, manageable pieces, and prioritize your responsibilities.</p>
